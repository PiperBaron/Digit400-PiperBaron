        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Hello! I'm Piper Baron!</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top:-12px;">This is my personal webpage.</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:-10px;">I'll try not to bore you with random facts about myself!</h3>
        <p style="font-size:16px;">My name is <b>Piper Baron</b>, and I'm an <i>artist</i>! I have a real passion for visual art (especially drawing/painting digitally), and I'd like to pursue some kind of career in concept art, UI design, or animtion for video games. Below is an example of my work (it's a self portrait!) You can see my full porfolio (still a work in progress) <a href="https://pub81.myportfolio.com/">here</a>!</p>
        <img alt="A stylized self-portait, done in Photoshop." src="https://i.imgur.com/c9M9A4y.png"/>
        <p>As for my interests, I really enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video games! I've played an absolutely shameful amount of World of Warcraft in my life.</li>
            <li>Mycology -- mushrooms are very fascinating!</li>
            <li>Horror movies! Because why not?</li>
            <li>K-Pop! Well this one is obvious given my project, but, hey.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>Here's a quote from one of my favorite books, The Hauting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson:</p>
        <blockquote style="font-size:20px;">“No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream.”</blockquote>
