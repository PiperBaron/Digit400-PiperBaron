            In their interview on Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio with Zane Lowe, member <memberRef ref="Mark">Mark</memberRef> — who was born in Canada — said:
            
            <blockQuote>"Even for us English speakers, it was hard, because we were already used to recording in Korean and everything. But we’ve realized that we wanted to focus on spreading our music to the world. And so, we needed an English version of the song, and we wanted our international fans to listen to it, as well. We thought that, as we were recording. So we also had to think of the vibe, as well, because it’s different from Korean. We wanted to deliver that the best way we could."</blockQuote>
